Statements that are neither true nor false until the value of a particular [[Propositional Variables]] is specified.

Using this we can represent [[Proposition]] as a function. Like $P(x)$, where value of $P(x)$ will be true or false depending on the value of $x$. This could be generalized using [[Propositional Function]] and [[n-ary Predicate]].
