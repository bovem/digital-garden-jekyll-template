Named after Greek mathematician [[Eratosthenes]]
It is used to find all primes not exceeding a number.

**Example**: To find all primes not exceeding 100
* 2 is a prime number. So we do not consider rest of the numbers that are less than 100 and divisible by 2 (other than 2).
* Continue this process for 3, 5, 7, ..........
