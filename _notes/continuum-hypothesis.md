We know that $|P(Z^{+})| = |P(R)| = \iota$. This could be rewritten as $2^{\aleph_0} = \iota$.

Cardinality of a [[Sets]] is always less than its [[Power Set]]. $|P(Z^{+})| > |Z^{+}|$. This could be rewritten as $2^{\aleph_0} > \aleph_0$.

This leads us to hypothesis that there exists no set $A$ such that:
$$|Z^{+}| < |A| < |R|$$
$$\aleph_0 < |A| < \iota$$
