$$((p \vee q) \wedge (\neg p \vee r)) \to (q \vee r)$$

Final [[Disjunction]] $(q \vee r)$ is called *Resolvent*.

Resolution plays an important role in programming language such as [[Prolog]].

It could be used to create [[Automated Theorem Proving Systems]].
For that [[Premises]] have to be expressed as [[Clauses]].
