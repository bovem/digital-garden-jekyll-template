$$\neg \forall xP(x) \equiv \exists !x \neg P(x)$$
$$\neg \exists !xP(x) \equiv \forall x \neg P(x)$$

This is true because [[Universal Quantifier]] is similar to [[Conjunction]] and [[Existential Quantifier]] is similar to [[Disjunction]].

It could be verified from [[Laws defined over compound propositions]].
