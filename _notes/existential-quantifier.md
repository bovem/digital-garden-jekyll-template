*Existential Quantification* of [[Propositional Function]] *P(x)* will be true over a particular domain if *P(x)* is true over any value in that domain.

It is denoted as $\exists xP(x)$.

Domain must be specified always.

To falsify an existential quantification *P(x)* has to be false on all values of domain.

If [[Domain of Discourse]] is empty then *P(x)* will always be false.

It is similar to [[Disjunction]] of P(x) over all values in domain [$x_1, x_n$].
$$P(x_1) \vee P(x_2) \vee \dots P(x_n)$$
