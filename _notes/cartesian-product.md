Named after French Mathematician [[Rene Descartes]].

Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets then cartesian product of these two sets (denoted as $A \times B$) is set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

$$A \times B = \{(a, b) | (a \in A) \wedge (b \in B)\}$$

Cartesian products $A \times B$ and $B \times A$ are not equal unless A=B=$\varnothing$.

Cartesian product of sets $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ denotes by $A_1 \times A_2 \times \dots A_n$ is set of [[Ordered n-tuples]] $(a_1, a_2, \dots a_n)$ where $a_i$ belongs to $A$ for $i=1, 2, \dots n$.

$$A_1 \times A_2 \times \dots A_n = \{ (a_1, a_2, \dots a_n) | a_i \in A_i\ for\ i=1, 2, \dots n \}$$
