Given two nonempty [[Sets]] $A$ and $B$. A *function* $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is assignment of a single element of $B$ to each element in $A$.

It could be denoted as $f(a) = b$ here $b$ is a *unique element* in set $B$ and $a$ is an element from set $A$. It could also be denoted as $f: A \rightarrow B$.

Functions are also known as *Mappings* or *Transformations*.

Function can also be defined as a [[Subsets]] of [[Relation]]. It is a relation from $A$ to $B$ that contains one and only one ordered pair $(a, b)$ for every element $a \in A$.
